                            <p>There are so many options to choose from when making a character. 
                                Let's look at some option DnD Beyond offers.</p>

                                <h1>Choosing a Race</h1>
                                <p>Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that 
                                    exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character 
                                    you want to play.Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for 
                                    building your character’s story. Each race’s description in this section includes information to help you roleplay a 
                                    character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. 
                                    These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. 
                                    It’s worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.</p>

                                <h1>Choosing a Class</h1>
                            <p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. 
                            Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse.
                            Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. 
                            At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features 
                            often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed 
                            explanation of each one. Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class.</p>

                                <h1>Styling Your Character</h1>
                            <p>Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, 
                            interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This section expounds on the 
                            details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the 
                            rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.</p>

                            <h1>Adding Equipment</h1>
                                <p>When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and background. 
                                Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the 
                                lists in this section. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.
                                You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods 
                                that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, 
                                and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, 
                                passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor’s 
                                adventurous footsteps.</p>
